      content: | 
        <div style="text-align: justify">My PhD was focused on the study of new generation of hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells - Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). 
        It included both experimental (spectroscopy, device fabrication and evaluation) and theoretical (modeling of the charge transfer processes in the time ranges from femtoseconds to milliseconds) work.
        I also worked on the modelling of tandem (multi-junction) solar cells.</div>
